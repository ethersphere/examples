This is a sample project that shows off the functionalities of the Swarm network, and serves as a simple example for developers looking to build a dApp that uses the decentralised Swarm storage with a vanilla ReactJs and Webpack setup.

## Dev Stacks

1. Node.js 16 or higher (LTS)
2. Webpack as the bundler
3. Modern React (functional components)
4. Latest @ethersphere/bee-js version

### Functionality

1. List available postage batches
2. Create new postage batch
3. Upload file(s)
4. Access to uploaded file
